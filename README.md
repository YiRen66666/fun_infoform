# 🎉 FunForm - Interactive Student Info Form

This is a simple and fun React-based form for collecting student information. It demonstrates key concepts like form validation, checkbox groups, dropdowns, and conditional messages.

## ✨ Features

- Input fields for:
  - Full Name
  - Student ID
  - Graduation Date
- Major selection (dropdown menu)
- Favourite Programming Languages (multi-checkbox with "Select All")
- Real-time input validation (e.g., Full Name format)
- Reset button to clear the form
- Dynamic warning messages for invalid input

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- React state and controlled components
- Form validation using regex or custom rules
- Conditional rendering
- Checkbox group logic (Select All / Unselect All)

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/funform.git
   cd funform

📌 Notes
The "Please input a valid full name" message appears when the full name input does not meet required format.

Graduation date input is a plain text field for now – can be enhanced with date pickers.
